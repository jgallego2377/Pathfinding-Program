# Pathfinding-Program
This program takes a text file with information about the # of edges and # of vertices. Given these two values, a graph is created with edges built by the values found inside the text file. The sole and primary function of this program is to relax a graph, given positive egdes, to find the shortest path from starting point s, to end point t (s->t). While doing this, the program also tracks the shortest distance needed. The program uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to obtain these goals. The entire path from s->t and the total cost is shown as output, depending on the console input provided.
